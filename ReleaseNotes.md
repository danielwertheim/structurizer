#Release notes

## v4.0.1
From this version release notes are kept in [each release](https://github.com/danielwertheim/structurizer/releases) on GitHub.

## v4.0.0 - 2018-11-16
- *New*: .NET Standard 2.0 instead of .NET Standard 1.3. Also supports .NET4.5.1 for a while more.
- *Changed*: Support for anonymous types passed as object.

## v3.1.0 - 2017-06-03
- *New*: Added `IStructureIndex.IsNumeric` to indicate if the carried value is numeric or not. Use `DataTypeCode` for more finegrained details.

## v3.0.0 - 2017-06-03
- *New*: `FlexibleStructureBuilder` which doesn't require you to pre-register types. It will do that automatically upon first contact with a new type. You can configure and reconfigure it at any time.
- *Changed*: `StructureTypeConfigurations` are now thread-safe and you can call register multiple times, last in wins.

## v2.0.0 - 2017-05-02
- Updated to target .NET Standard 1.3
- Now also extracting attributes from properties for those using Structurizer for meta-data and schema stuff.

## v1.0.0 - 2016-11-28
Might be weird you think to set 1.0.0 so soon. Remember that the code comes from two generations. One generation from the PineCone project and one from SisoDB. Structurizer is based upon this. But with a lot of stuff removed.

With this release focus has been on performance and resource usage. Read more here: http://danielwertheim.se/structurizer-improvements/

## v0.2.0 - 2016-11-13
- Breaking changes in API to simplify usage of Structurizer.
- Added possibility of per type define `IndexMode.Inclusive|Exclusive`.
- `StructureProperty.SetValue` is removed. Structurizer is about reading values.
- Indexes paths has now changed. When part of something that is enumerable (arrays, lists, collections etc.) there will be an indicator telling at what position the value was.

You get:

```
OrderLines[0].ArticleNo="123454"
OrderLines[0].Qty=1
OrderLines[1].ArticleNo="123454"
OrderLines[1].Qty=3
```

instead off:

```

OrderLines.Qty=1
OrderLines.ArticleNo="123454"
OrderLines.Qty=3
```

## v0.1.0 - 2016-05-24
